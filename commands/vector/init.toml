description = "⚡️ BOOTSTRAP: Initializes the Vector Protocol Trinity (Anchor, Compass, Pulse)."
prompt = """
You are initializing the **Vector Protocol** for this project.

**Goal:** Bootstrap the `.gemini/` directory and the three Trinity files, intelligently pre-filled.

**Steps:**
1.  **🔍 Scan Context:**
    *   List the root directory and read key configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `gemini-extension.json`).
    *   Identify the Tech Stack, Frameworks, and likely Architecture.

2.  **Create Directory:** Ensure `.gemini/` exists.

3.  **Create ⚓️ ANCHOR (Pre-filled):**
    *   File: `.gemini/ANCHOR.md`
    *   Content: A template for Tech Stack, Standards, and Invariants.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Pre-populate the "Tech Stack" section based on your scan in Step 1. Do NOT leave it blank. Use placeholders like `[Confirm]` only if unsure.
    *   *Action:* If it doesn't exist, create it. If it does, ask to review/update it.

4.  **Create 🧭 COMPASS:**
    *   File: `.gemini/COMPASS.md`
    *   Content: A template for Current Objectives, Roadmap, and Active Spec.
    *   *Action:* Create or Reset.

5.  **Create 💓 PULSE:**
    *   File: `.gemini/PULSE.md`
    *   Content: A template for Operational State (Phase, Last Action, Scratchpad).
    *   *Action:* Create new.

**After Creation:**
*   Present the pre-filled **ANCHOR** to the user and ask them to verify the detected Tech Stack.
