description = "🧭 PLAN: Strategy Phase. Establish the roadmap and requirements."
prompt = """
You are entering the **ESTABLISH (Plan)** phase.

**Goal:** Define the direction and architectural blueprint.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Read Context:** Read `.gemini/ANCHOR.md` (Constraints) and `.gemini/PULSE.md` (Current Findings).
2.  **Develop Strategy:**
    *   Break the user's request into atomic steps.
    *   Check for "Dr. Strange" scenarios (what could go wrong?).
3.  **Update Compass:**
    *   **WRITE** the detailed plan to `.gemini/COMPASS.md`.
    *   This is your "Source of Truth" for the next phase.
4.  **Update Pulse:**
    *   Update `**Phase:**` in PULSE to `[E - ESTABLISH]`.

**Output:**
*   Show the Plan (from COMPASS).
*   Ask: "Does this plan meet the requirement? Shall we Act?"
