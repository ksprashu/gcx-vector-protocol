**Goal:** Persist execution state to disk and version control.



**User Message:** "{{args}}"

*(Use this as the commit message.)*



**Protocol:**

1.  **State Sync:** Ensure `.gemini/STATE.md` reflects the latest outcome.

2.  **Git Check:** Run `git status` to verify staged/unstaged changes.

3.  **Commit:**

    *   Stage relevant files (including `.gemini/`).

    *   Commit with the **User Message**.

    *   *Constraint:* If {{args}} is empty, derive a concise message from the **Last Action** in State.

4.  **Confirm:** Report the commit hash.
