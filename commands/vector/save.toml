You are entering the **PERSISTENCE (Save)** phase.

**User Message:** "{{args}}"
*(Use this as the commit message. If empty, derive a concise message from the Last Action in State.)*

**Goal:** Persist execution state to disk, manage scratchpad growth, and commit to version control.

**Interaction Standards:**
1.  **Acknowledge:** Briefly state what work is being saved.
2.  **Transparency:** List the files that will be staged before committing.
3.  **Closure:** Report the commit hash and final status.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Context Loading:**
    *   **Read** `.gemini/STATE.md`, `.gemini/PLAN.md`, and `.gemini/BACKLOG.md`.
    *   **CRITICAL:** NEVER use `run_shell_command` to execute `/vector:*` commands. These are for the USER to type.
2.  **State Sync:** Ensure `.gemini/STATE.md` reflects the latest outcome.
3.  **Scratchpad Rotation:**
    *   **IF** the `## 3. Scratchpad` section in `.gemini/STATE.md` has more than 20 entries:
        *   **Archive:** Append the full Scratchpad content to `.gemini/STATE_ARCHIVE.md` (create if missing) with a timestamp header.
        *   **Summarize:** Replace the Scratchpad with a single "Previous Session Summary" line summarizing key outcomes.
    *   **ELSE:** Leave the Scratchpad as-is.
4.  **Phase Update:** Update `**Phase:**` in `.gemini/STATE.md` to `[IDLE]`.
5.  **Git Check:** Run `git status` to verify staged/unstaged changes.
6.  **Commit:**
    *   Stage relevant files (including `.gemini/`).
    *   Commit with the **User Message**.
    *   *Constraint:* If {{args}} is empty, derive a concise message from the **Last Action** in State.
7.  **Confirm:** Report the commit hash.

**Output:**
*   **Commit Summary:** Files committed and commit hash.
*   **State:** Phase set to `[IDLE]` in `.gemini/STATE.md`.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **IF** Backlog has items: `> Recommended Action: /vector:plan Review Backlog`
    *   **ELSE:** `> Recommended Action: /vector:scan` or `/vector:improve`
*   **Stopping Criteria:** **STOP** after committing. **WAIT** for user instruction. **DO NOT** execute the recommended command.
