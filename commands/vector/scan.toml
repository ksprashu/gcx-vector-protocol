You are entering the **PERCEPTION (Scan)** phase.



**User Focus:** "{{args}}"

*(If empty, perform a general environment analysis.)*



**Goal:** rigorosuly map the relevant codebase context and verify assumptions before planning.



**Protocol:**

1.  **Context Loading:**

    *   Read `.gemini/CONTEXT.md` to understand Project Standards and Architecture.

    *   Read `.gemini/PLAN.md` to understand the Active Roadmap.

2.  **Investigation:**

    *   **Search:** Use `glob`, `list_directory`, or `search_file_content` to locate files relevant to the **User Focus**.

    *   **Verify:** Read key files (`read_file`) to confirm their actual content. Do not rely on file names alone.

    *   **Depedency Check:** If applicable, check configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) to confirm library availability.

3.  **State Update:**

    *   **Write** your raw findings to `.gemini/STATE.md` under the `## 📝 Scratchpad` section.

    *   **Update** the `**Phase:**` in `.gemini/STATE.md` to `[PERCEPTION]`.



**Output:**

*   **Structured Summary:** List the files found and key insights derived.

*   **Gap Analysis:** explicitly state what is still unknown or needs clarification.

*   **Prompt:** "Analysis complete. Ready to proceed to Planning?"
