You are entering the **PERCEPTION (Scan)** phase.

**User Focus:** "{{args}}"
*(If empty, perform a general environment analysis.)*

**Goal:** Rigorously map the relevant codebase context and **Reconcile** the 4-File System State.

**Interaction Standards:**
1.  **Acknowledge & Rephrase:** Briefly state what you are scanning and why.
2.  **Checklist:** Present findings as a structured list.
3.  **Drift Detection:** Explicitly flag discrepancies between `PLAN.md`, `STATE.md`, and Reality.
4.  **Evidence Discipline:** Collect official references for each major decision in this phase.

**Protocol:**
1.  **State Audit (The 4-File Check):**
    *   **Read ALL** existing protocol files: `.gemini/CONTEXT.md`, `.gemini/PLAN.md`, `.gemini/STATE.md`, and `.gemini/BACKLOG.md` (if it exists).
    *   **CRITICAL:** NEVER use `run_shell_command` to execute `/vector:*` commands. These are for the USER to type.
2.  **Investigation:**
    *   **Search:** Use `glob`, `list_directory`, or `search_file_content` to locate files relevant to the **User Focus**.
    *   **Verify:** Read key files (`read_file`) to confirm their actual content. Do not rely on file names alone.
3.  **External Evidence Pass (Mandatory):**
    *   Before producing recommendations, collect authoritative external references (official docs/specs/release notes) for every major conclusion and recommended next action.
    *   Build an Evidence Table with columns: **Topic | Source | Why authoritative | Last-checked**.
    *   If evidence is stale, conflicting, or incomplete, **HALT** and request user direction.
4.  **State Update:**
    *   **Write** your raw findings to `.gemini/STATE.md` under the `## 3. Scratchpad` section.
    *   **Constraint:** **PRESERVE** any existing session history. Append new findings.
    *   **Update** the `**Phase:**` in `.gemini/STATE.md` to `[PERCEPTION]`.

**Output:**
*   **Structured Checklist:** List files found and insights as `- [x] Found ...`.
*   **Drift Report:** "Plan says X, but Codebase shows Y."
*   **Evidence Table:** Include columns **Topic | Source | Why authoritative | Last-checked**.
*   **Prompt:** "Analysis complete. Ready to proceed to Planning?"
*   **Navigation:** Append:
    *   **IF** New Plan needed: `> Recommended Action: /vector:plan <objective>`
    *   **IF** Ideas found for later: `> Recommended Action: /vector:improve`
*   **Stopping Criteria:** DO NOT generate a plan. DO NOT modify code. If evidence is stale/conflicting/incomplete, **HALT** and request user direction. Otherwise, **STOP** and **WAIT** for the user to select the next action. **DO NOT** execute the recommended command.
