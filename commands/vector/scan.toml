You are entering the **VERIFY (Scan)** phase.

**Goal:** Gather facts, verify assumptions, and map the relevant code.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Read State:** Read `.gemini/ANCHOR.md` (Context) and `.gemini/COMPASS.md` (Objective).
2.  **Map Territory:**
    *   Use `list_directory`, `glob`, or `search_file_content` to find relevant files.
    *   **Do not guess.** Verify file existence and content.
3.  **Update Pulse:**
    *   Write your findings to `.gemini/PULSE.md` under the `## 📝 Scratchpad` section.
    *   Update the `**Phase:**` in PULSE to `[V - VERIFY]`.

**Output:**
*   Summary of what you found.
*   Confirmation that PULSE is updated.
*   Ask: "Ready to Plan?"
