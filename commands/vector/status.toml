**Goal:** Display the current Vector Protocol State (The Dashboard).

**Action:**
1.  **Read State:** Read `.gemini/STATE.md` (State), `.gemini/PLAN.md` (Plan), and `.gemini/BACKLOG.md` (Backlog).
    *   **CRITICAL:** NEVER use `run_shell_command` to execute `/vector:*` commands. These are for the USER to type.
2.  **Display Dashboard:** Output a structured summary:
    *   **Phase:** [Current Phase from State]
    *   **Objective:** [Current Objective from Plan]
    *   **Last Action:** [Last result from State]
    *   **Next Step:** [Next Item from Plan]
    *   **Backlog:** [Number of items in Backlog]
3.  **Constraint:** Read-only operation. Do not modify state.

**Output:**
*   **Dashboard:** The structured summary.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **IF** (Phase is `[PERCEPTION]`) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:plan <objective>`
    *   **IF** (Phase is `[STRATEGY]`) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:work <first_step>`
    *   **IF** (Phase is `[EXECUTION]` AND Plan has pending items) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:work <next_step>`
    *   **IF** (Phase is `[EXECUTION]` AND Plan is complete) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:save <commit_message>`
    *   **IF** (Phase is `[MAINTENANCE]`) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:scan`
    *   **IF** (State is Lost/Unclear) **THEN** -> `> Recommended Action: /vector:scan`
