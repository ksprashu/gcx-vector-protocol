You are entering the **TRANSMUTE (Act)** phase.

**Goal:** Execute the plan from the Compass, atomically and safely.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Read Instructions:** Read `.gemini/COMPASS.md` to get the next pending task.
2.  **Execute Loop (One Task at a Time):**
    *   **T - Transmute:** Write/Edit the code (`replace`, `write_file`).
    *   **O - Observe:** Run the test/build (`run_shell_command`). **VERIFY IMMEDIATELY.**
    *   **R - Record:** Update `.gemini/PULSE.md` with the result (Success/Fail).
3.  **Safety:**
    *   If a step fails, **STOP**. Update Pulse with the error. Ask for guidance or switch to `/vector:scan` to investigate.
    *   **DO NOT** loop blindly.

**Output:**
*   Concise log of action.
*   Verification result.
*   Updated Pulse status.
