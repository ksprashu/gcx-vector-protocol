You are entering the **EXECUTION (Act)** phase.



**User Instruction:** "{{args}}"

*(Use this to select a specific task or guide the immediate action.)*



**Goal:** Execute the approved plan atomically, with immediate verification.



**Protocol:**

1.  **Task Retrieval:**

    *   Read `.gemini/PLAN.md` to identify the next pending task.

    *   If "{{args}}" is provided, prioritize that instruction within the context of the plan.

2.  **Execution Loop (Atomic Step):**

    *   **Implement:** Use `replace` or `write_file` to make the code change.

        *   *Constraint:* Adhere strictly to `.gemini/CONTEXT.md` (Standards).

    *   **Verify:** IMMEDIATELY run the build or test command (`run_shell_command`).

        *   *Constraint:* Do not proceed if verification fails.

    *   **Record:** Update `.gemini/STATE.md` with the result (Success/Failure) and output log.

3.  **Error Handling:**

    *   If verification fails, **STOP**.

    *   Log the error in `.gemini/STATE.md`.

    *   Propose a fix or request a strategy review (`/vector:scan`).



**Output:**

*   **Action Log:** Concise summary of the change and verification result.

*   **State:** Updated status in `.gemini/STATE.md`.

*   **Prompt:** "Task complete. Proceed to next step?"
